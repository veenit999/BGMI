			<div id="ranked"></div>
			<p class="text">There are six maps in Battlegrounds Mobile India for players to rank push in, namely - Erangel, Miramar, Sanhok, Vikendi, Livik, and Karakin.<br><br> Amongst the several maps available in the game, Miramar is the best map for a rank push in BGMI.</p>

				<div class="maps">ERANGLE</div>
				<div id="erangle"></div>
				<p class="text">Erangel was the first map the game had to offer when it was first launched in the year 2018. It took another year to finally introduce the other three PlayerUnknown’S Battleground maps: Vikendi, Miramar and Sanhok. There are tons of backstories behind Erangel map. Some say that Erangel existed as “Wrangel” in Russia in real life while others have an opinion that Erangel is named on the daughter of PLAYERUNKNOWN’S, “Eryn”.<br><br> The map measures 8x8kms in area and once you’re down there, it’s you against the island.

				<div id="nusa"></div>
				<p class="text">The Nusa map in PUBG mobile is special since it has the smallest play area and the fastest gameplay. The smallest map 1×1 kilometers provides a smaller blue zone that moves more quickly than the other maps. It increases the difficulty and promotes engaging gameplay</p>

				<div class="maps">LIVIK</div>
				<div id="livik"></div>
				<p class="text">Livik map in PUBG is the newest map in the PUBG Mobile’s recent update v0.19.0 and the map is quite small (2km x 2km) compared to the other existing maps in the game. This small map intense fights as there is not much surface area to run away and hide and amazing loot all over the map. The Livik map has a unique terrain that makes players confused about their surroundings.

				<div class="maps">SANHOK</div>
				<div id="sanhok"></div>
				<p class="text">Sanhok (Codename: Savage) is the 3rd playable map but the 4th map in total for BATTLEGROUNDS, Sanhok is a 4x4km island compared to other maps that are 8x8km. Sanhok is the first map where BATTLEGROUNDS implemented a dynamic circle. This dynamic circle sees how many players are alive then will calculate if the blue zone should move faster or slower throughout the match.
